  "Pure, portable (.cljc — JVM/ClojureScript/nbb/SCI) ordered-fallback
  resolution: given a map of {source-key (fn [ref] value-or-nil)} and a
  spec {:order [source-key ...] source-key ref ...}, try each source in
  order and return the first non-nil result. No I/O of its own — the host
  (secret-resolve.core, secret-resolve.sources) supplies the concrete
  source functions (env var lookup, `op read`, macOS Keychain, or fakes for
  testing).

  This is the generalized shape already used by this workspace's
  `manifest/repos.edn` `:b2 :credentials` (env → 1password → keychain) —
  extracted here so it has exactly one implementation instead of being
  hand-copied per consumer (it had already been copied into at least two
  places before this library existed)."

  shape that source's fn expects (a plain string env-var name / op://
  path, or a map for keychain). Returns the first non-nil, non-blank
  result, or nil if every source in :order returned nothing. A source fn
  that throws is treated as \"unavailable\", not fatal — resolution falls
  through to the next source."
